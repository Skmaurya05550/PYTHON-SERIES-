# Python Introduction

## Overview

This chapter introduces Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## What is Python?

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages.

## Key Features of Python

- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that facilitate various tasks.
- **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, providing support and resources for developers.

## Installing Python

To get started with Python, you need to install it on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. **Download Python**:
   - Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Install Python**:
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts.
   - Make sure to check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open your command line (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed version of Python.

## Running Your First Python Program

Once you have installed Python, you can run your first program. Follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, PyCharm).
2. Create a new file named `hello.py` and add the following code:
   ```python
   # This is a simple Hello World program
   print("Hello, World!")
